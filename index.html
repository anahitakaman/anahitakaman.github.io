<h2>
This is about my story on Wattpad- Falling Too Far.
</h2>
<h3> Noelle Richards, meet Harper Andrews. </h3>
<h4>Noelle Richards.
An introvert, adorable, shy, obsessed with books, classified a type-A nerd, and has never fallen in love.

And here we have none other than Harper Andrews.
A bad boy, cocky, arrogant and charming- not to mention his notorious reputation of breaking hearts.

What happens when you put the ever so cliche good girl and bad boy together?
Why, fighting, panic attacks, social anxiety, arguments and shouting, of course.
But is it possible that they will find...
Love?

Soon enough, Noelle will find herself falling.
